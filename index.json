[{"content":"I chosed my GNU/Linux distribution! If you\u0026rsquo;ve been a GNU/Linux user you should be aware of GNU/Linux distribution and their variety. This feature make GNU/Linux kind of spcial because it can give a wide range of options and also make it confusing for the beginners to start working with GNU/Linux.\nHow do i reach the conclusion? Well like most of the GNU/Linux users i hop over few GNU/Linux distributions. My first distro was Ubuntu it was solid and i really like the Unity desktop environment (nowadays Ubuntu ships with Gnome desktop env which is not my favorite!) but there were one problem most of the apps are old and i need fresh ones so i was compiling from source! I admit i learn lots things but it was time consuming. Next distro was Arch (YES i used arch BTW ;) ) it was beautiful and good but if you are not using it for few weeks it easily breaks because of old keyrings. But i liked the experience especially because i used a window manager not a full desktop environment LOVE IT!\nSo i reinstalled it but it breaks again and yes it\u0026rsquo;s time to change again.\nI looked at two distros:\nFedora void Linux Void is beautiful because you can use any system init that you want like runit or openRC but installation process and get started and redo all the workspace requirements could be time consuming so i have now choice to check fedora first but not normal fedora the I3 spin of fedora which is light and great.\nAfter a while that i studied about the package manager the DNF and packaging format the RPM. The cool thing about RPM is when you want to upgrade there is DRPM which the differential package that could reduce the download heavily and make the upgrade process faster.\nthe roll backs are active by default the dnf command and flags are so good the representation is so beautiful (Not like apt)\nSo of course the result is Fedora.\nBut i am going to test void to see how it goes.\n","permalink":"https://ali-molajani.github.io/posts/my_distro/","summary":"I chosed my GNU/Linux distribution!
