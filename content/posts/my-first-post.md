# Why you need a site?
1. Some times i really sense to share my thoughts and discoveries in tech with people because i see problems that can engage them and consumes thier time due to lack of experience where here we hope can do our best to show case newer and more efficient frameworks or technologies to make everyone's life a little bit easier.
2. *I enjoy it!* yes that simple ;)

# Contact:
I prefer not to use social networks but for sake of being connected i suggest two ways:
1. ask your question in <span style="color: red;">*Quora*</span>.
2. Join the *matrix group* or message in private space.
3. send E-mail.

Thanks for your time and hope you enjoy !!
